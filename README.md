### Attention ###

The code here will need some testing in an actual articulatory synthesis setup to make absolutely sure everything is correct.

Some more cleaning can be done, but at this point I consider it optional (we can deal with it if we publish this code).

### Instructions ###

* Take the tracking mat files of a speaker and put it in a directory (This will be your trackPath)
* Open a directory to store results (outPath)
* Edit accordingly lines 43-44 of config.m

* Run wrap_build_model. The result will be a contourdata.mat file in outPath
